    "description": "I think the best front-end developer that I think subjectively is someone who can flexibly deliver any information to users independently of the platform. Adhere to two principles to be a good developer, not just a coder. Do not write unprovoked code. Even if it's a single line of code, or even a copy and paste code, I consider the existence of that code. I don't marry with technology. Promote the thinking capabilities of the developers without insisting on specific technologies in the fast-changing flood of technologies."
